                <p>Hi, my name is Bo Salinas. I use they/them pronouns. I was born in California and raised in Texas. I worked in Special
                    Education for a few years before starting this new challenge of becoming a web developer. I'm in the beginning of
                    my journey to become an excellent web developer.
                    In a nutshell, I want to create websites that help organizations address business challenges and meet
                    their needs.
